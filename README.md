## Overview

This program was designed to automate the creation of a joint savings accounts with the use of Solidity. This smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

---

## Requirements


This project leverages python 3.7 and Streamlit, hashlib, web3, eth-tester, mnemonic and bip44.

The following libraries were used:

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - *version 1.3.2* - This was used to be able to easily manipulate dataframes and create dataframes.

* [hashlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html)- This module implements a common interface to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms. In our application, we use SHA256 to return a hexdigest.

* [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html) - This is a Python library for connecting to and performing operations on Ethereum-based blockchains.

* [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/) - This is used to create the smart contract and implement the joints saving application to work with ether.

* [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) - This is used to be able to write and edit solidity formatted code, and this is where the joints saving application will be launched.

## User Experience

Once you clone the file from this repository, launch REMIX IDE to view and edit the joint_savings.sol file. Then when on the REMIX IDE, click on the left icon logo, and then click Open file and navigate to where the git clone files are locally saved on your machine.

## Visualization

### Compile the `joint_savings.sol` file and make sure that the compiler is version 0.5.0.
